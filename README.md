CHATTERBOX
==========

Makers Academy PreCourse Challenge 3

I adapted a basic chatbot program to add more functionality, for example:
* Extended from 2 to 4 regex capture groups, allowing more dynamic input.
* Implemented a 'quit' command to exit the program.
* User input is preceded & colour coded by 'User: ', and responses by 'Chatbot: '. The Add a response menu is indicated in yellow.
* Defined an add_response method to add new custom inputs and responses from within the program, instead of hardcoding them.
* Load/Save functionality - All questions and responses are saved into questions.csv, including custom add_response questions, and loaded again once the program starts.

Still to do
-----------

* Further refactor and clean up code.
* Extend add_response to add multiple questions at once.
