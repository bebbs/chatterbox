CHATTERBOX
==========

Makers Academy PreCourse Challenge 3

I adapted a basic chatbot program to add more functionality, for example:
* Extended from 2 to 4 regex capture groups, allowing more dynamic input.
* Implemented a 'quit' command to exit the program.
* Created a distinction between user input and chatbot response.
* Defined an add_response method to add new custom inputs and responses from within the program, instead of hardcoding them.
* Load/Save functionality - All questions and responses are saved into questions.csv, including custom add_response questions, and loaded again once the program starts.

Still to do
-----------

* Add colour within the terminal output to further differentiate input and response.
